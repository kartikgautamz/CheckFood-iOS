This app will tell you if the capture or uploaded image is a hotdog or not by using Machine Learning.

Our Goal

One of the most fundamental component of modern iOS apps is the Table View. Table Views are used everywhere from the Mail app to the Messages app. It’s a crucial part of every iOS developer’s tool belt. In this tutorial we’ll be getting to grips with Table Views, creating custom cells, and making our own cloud-based backend database. It’s going to be epic, so buckle up.

What we will create

CheckFood is an app that uses Inceptionv3 machine learning model to recognise the food or in our app's case whther its a "hotdog" or "not a hotdog".
